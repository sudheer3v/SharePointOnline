# Troubleshooting Guide: SharePoint Site Pages Publishing Error  

## Issue  
User accidentally deleted the **Publish Start Date** column from **Site Pages** Library and since then Users are unable to publish a SharePoint site page. The error displayed:  
**"Invalid Field Name, {1488b62f-b70f4f75-a384-7a04fbada949}"**

---

## Symptoms  
- Pages fail to publish.  
- Error references a field GUID, indicating a missing or invalid column.  

---

## Root Cause  
The error occurred because the **Publish Start Date** column was deleted from the **Site Pages** library. This column is automatically created when the **Scheduling** feature is enabled. Deleting it manually disrupts publishing functionality.  

---

## Resolution Steps  

### 1. Diagnosis  
1. **Identify the Missing Column**:  
   - Run the following PowerShell script to check which column corresponds to the GUID:  
     ```powershell
     Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite" -Interactive
     $field = Get-PnPField -Identity "1488b62f-b70f4f75-a384-7a04fbada949"
     $field | Select Title, InternalName, Id
     ```  
   - This revealed that the GUID corresponds to the **Publish Start Date** column.  

2. **Reproduce the Issue**:  
   - Tested in a separate site to confirm behavior:  
     - Enabled the **Scheduling** feature.  
     - Deleted the **Publish Start Date** column.  
     - Verified that publishing failed with the same error.

### 2. Resolution  
#### Option 1: Re-add the Column Manually  
   - Checked if the column could be re-added from **Site Columns**, since out-of-the-box (OOTB) columns, when deleted from a library, are only removed from that specific library and remain available at the site level under **Site Columns**.  
   - This approach did **not resolve** the issue, likely because SharePoint requires the column to be re-created by the feature.  

#### Option 2: Reset the Scheduling Feature  
   - Disabled and re-enabled the **Scheduling** feature in the **Site Pages** library:  
     1. Navigate to the Site Pages library.  
     2. On the top ribbon click **Scheduling**.  
     3. Disable the feature and save.  
     4. Re-enable the feature and save.  
   - This action re-created the **Publish Start Date** and **Publish End Date** columns automatically.  

---

### 3. Testing and Implementation  
1. **Backup**:  
   - Took a backup of the site before making any changes.  
2. **Applied Fix in Production**:  
   - Disabled and re-enabled the **Scheduling** feature.  
3. **Validation**:  
   - Verified the fix by publishing a test page.  
   - User also confirmed successful publishing after testing.

## Lessons Learned  
- **Column Deletion Impact**: Columns created by features should not be manually deleted, as they may disrupt critical functionality.  
- **Resetting Features**: Disabling and re-enabling a feature can be an effective way to restore its default state.  
- **Testing**: Always test changes in a non-production environment before applying them to live sites.

## Challenges  
- Microsoft Support was contacted previously for this issue, but they were unable to provide a timely resolution despite extensive meetings, logs, and escalations.  
- A simple "reset" approach resolved the problem efficiently, avoiding further delays.
